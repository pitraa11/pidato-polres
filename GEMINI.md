# Project Overview

This is a Laravel 12 web application. It uses a standard Laravel stack with PHP 8.2, and the frontend is built using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.

The project structure follows the standard Laravel directory layout. Key directories include:
- `app/`: Contains the core application code (Models, Controllers, etc.).
- `routes/`: Holds the application's route definitions.
- `resources/views/`: Contains the Blade templates for the UI.
- `database/`: Includes database migrations, seeders, and factories.
- `config/`: Stores all of the application's configuration files.
- `tests/`: Contains the application's test suite.

# Building and Running

### 1. Initial Setup

To set up the project for the first time, run the following command. This will install PHP and JS dependencies, create a `.env` file, generate an application key, run database migrations, and build the frontend assets.

```bash
composer setup
```

### 2. Running the Development Environment

To start the local development environment, which includes the PHP server, queue worker, log watcher, and Vite server, use the following command:

```bash
composer run dev
```

- The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- The Vite server handles hot-reloading for frontend assets.

### 3. Running Tests

To run the project's test suite, use the following command:

```bash
composer test
```
This will execute the PHPUnit tests defined in the `tests/` directory.

# Development Conventions
